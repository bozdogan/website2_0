    <p>
      That website was a part of a school project. Since it fulfilled its purpose during
      2019 spring season, it is no longer needed to be open to visitors. This website has
      been an educative work for me and now it is time to move on. Thanks for visiting my
      website during this time. You can follow me on twitter if you'd like. (Note that I'm
      posting Turkish there.) 
    </p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>
